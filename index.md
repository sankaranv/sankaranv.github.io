I am a first-year MS student at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), where I currently work with the [Knowledge Discovery Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/kdl/). My primary interests are in (a) building explainable machine learning models and (b) explaining existing machine learning models. My research lies at the intersection of Machine Learning, Causal Inference and Network Science.

Before coming to UMass, I worked at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) as a Project Associate, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). I was associated with the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/) and the [RISE-IIL Lab](https://rise-iil.github.io). My primary work was on hypergraph clustering with modularity and spectral methods. In the process, I was also fortunate to work in collaboration with [Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/), The Ohio State University.

Prior to this, I graduated with a B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [SSN College of Engineering](http://www.ssn.edu.in/), affliated to [Anna University](https://www.annauniv.edu/).

                    Clustering on hypergraphs has been garnering increased attention with potential applications in network analysis, VLSI design and computer vision, among others. In this work, we generalize the framework of modularity maximization for clustering on hypergraphs. To this end, we introduce a hypergraph null model, analogous to the configuration model on undirected graphs, and a node-degree preserving reduction to work with this model. This is used to define a modularity function that can be maximized using the popular and fast Louvain algorithm. We additionally propose a refinement over this clustering, by reweighting cut hyperedges in an iterative fashion. The efficacy and efficiency of our methods are demonstrated on several real-world datasets.
